# Scalable Foundation Interatomic Potentials via

This is the experimental code for the paper **Scalable Foundation Interatomic Potentials via Message-Passing Pruning and Graph Partitioning**. In the MatterTune documentation, we provide instructions on how to install the environment dependencies and use this acceleration workflow.

## Li$_3$PO$_4$

The dataset can be acquired from the [Allegro paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36329-y). 

For model training, run ```train.py```

For quenching simulation, run ```md.py```

## SiO$_x$

The dataset can be acquired from [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45840-9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45840-9). 

For model training, run ```train.py```

For segregation simulation, run ```md.py```

## PtTiO$_2$

For legitimate academic purposes, we can provide the training dataset. 

For model training, run ```train.py```

For SIMI simulation, run ```md.py```
