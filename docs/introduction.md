# Introduction

## Motivation

Atomistic Foundation Models have emerged as powerful tools in molecular and materials science. However, the diverse implementations of these open-source models, with their varying architectures and interfaces, create significant barriers for customized fine-tuning and downstream applications.

MatterTune is a comprehensive platform that addresses these challenges through systematic yet general abstraction of Atomistic Foundation Model architectures. By adopting a modular design philosophy, MatterTune provides flexible and concise user interfaces that enable intuitive and efficient fine-tuning workflows.
